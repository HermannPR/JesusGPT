"},{"verse":18,"text":"  This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.

"},{"verse":10,"text":"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great delight. "},{"verse":11,"text":"On coming to the house, they saw the Child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.

"},{"verse":13,"text":"  When the Magi had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him.” "},{"verse":14,"text":"So he got up, took the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt, "},{"verse":15,"text":"where he stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.” "},{"verse":16,"text":"  When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was filled with rage. Sending orders, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi.

His food was locusts and wild honey. "},{"verse":5,"text":"People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region around the Jordan.

"},{"verse":16,"text":"As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him. "},{"verse":17,"text":"And a voice from heaven said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!”  "}]},{"chapter":4,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.” "},{"verse":64,"text":"“You have said it yourself,” Jesus answered. “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” "},{"verse":65,"text":"At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. "},{"verse":66,"text":"What do you think?”  “He deserves to die,” they answered. "},{"verse":67,"text":"Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him "},{"verse":68,"text":"and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ!

"},{"verse":12,"text":"And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer. "},{"verse":13,"text":"Then Pilate asked Him, “Do You not hear how many charges they are bringing against You?” "},{"verse":14,"text":"But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement. "},{"verse":15,"text":"  Now it was the governor’s custom at the feast to release to the crowd a prisoner of their choosing. "},{"verse":16,"text":"At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas. "},{"verse":17,"text":"So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” "},{"verse":18,"text":"For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.

"},{"verse":31,"text":"After they had mocked Him, they removed the robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him away to crucify Him. "},{"verse":32,"text":"  Along the way they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus. "},{"verse":33,"text":"And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull, "},{"verse":34,"text":"they offered Him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it.

"},{"verse":45,"text":"  From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.

All the people came to Him, and He taught them there.

Then how will you understand any of the parables? "},{"verse":14,"text":"The farmer sows the word. "},{"verse":15,"text":"Some are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. "},{"verse":16,"text":"Some are like the seeds sown on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it with joy. "},{"verse":17,"text":"But they themselves have no root, and they remain for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. "},{"verse":18,"text":"Others are like the seeds sown among the thorns. They hear the word, "},{"verse":19,"text":"but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. "},{"verse":20,"text":"Still others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.” "},{"verse":21,"text":"  Jesus also said to them, “Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under a basket or under a bed? Doesn’t he set it on a stand? "},{"verse":22,"text":"For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light. "},{"verse":23,"text":"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.” "},{"verse":24,"text":"He went on to say, “Pay attention to what you hear.

"},{"verse":32,"text":"But after it is planted, it grows to be the largest of all garden plants and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air nest in its shade.” "},{"verse":33,"text":"With many such parables Jesus spoke the word to them, to the extent that they could understand. "},{"verse":34,"text":"He did not tell them anything without using a parable. But privately He explained everything to His own disciples.

"},{"verse":40,"text":"“Why are you so afraid?” He asked. “Do you still have no faith?” "},{"verse":41,"text":"Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one another, “Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”  "}]},{"chapter":5,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" On the other side of the sea, they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes."},{"verse":2,"text":"As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs. "},{"verse":3,"text":"This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains. "},{"verse":4,"text":"Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him. "},{"verse":5,"text":"Night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he kept crying out and cutting himself with stones. "},{"verse":6,"text":"When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees before Him. "},{"verse":7,"text":"And he shouted in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You before God not to torture me!” "},{"verse":8,"text":"For Jesus had already declared, “Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!” "},{"verse":9,"text":"“What is your name?” Jesus asked.  “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.” "},{"verse":10,"text":"And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of that region. "},{"verse":11,"text":"There on the nearby hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. "},{"verse":12,"text":"So the demons begged Jesus, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.” "},{"verse":13,"text":"He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water."},{"verse":14,"text":"Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. "},{"verse":15,"text":"When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. "},{"verse":16,"text":"Those who had seen it described what had happened to the demon-possessed man and also to the pigs. "},{"verse":17,"text":"And the people began to beg Jesus to leave their region. "},{"verse":18,"text":"As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the demons begged to go with Him. "},{"verse":19,"text":"But Jesus would not allow him. “Go home to your own people,” He said, “and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy He has shown you.” "},{"verse":20,"text":"So the man went away and began to proclaim throughout the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed. "},{"verse":21,"text":"  When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him beside the sea. "},{"verse":22,"text":"A synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at His feet "},{"verse":23,"text":"and pleaded with Him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.” "},{"verse":24,"text":"So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around Him. "},{"verse":25,"text":"And a woman was there who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. "},{"verse":26,"text":"She had borne much agony under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse. "},{"verse":27,"text":"When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up through the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak. "},{"verse":28,"text":"For she kept saying, “If only I touch His garments, I will be healed.” "},{"verse":29,"text":"Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she sensed in her body that she was healed of her affliction. "},{"verse":30,"text":"At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, “Who touched My garments?” "},{"verse":31,"text":"His disciples answered, “You can see the crowd pressing in on You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’” "},{"verse":32,"text":"But He kept looking around to see who had done this. "},{"verse":33,"text":"Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him trembling in fear, and she told Him the whole truth. "},{"verse":34,"text":"“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free of your affliction.” "},{"verse":35,"text":"While He was still speaking, messengers from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead; why bother the Teacher anymore?” "},{"verse":36,"text":"But Jesus overheard their conversation and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe.” "},{"verse":37,"text":"And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. "},{"verse":38,"text":"When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and wailing loudly. "},{"verse":39,"text":"He went inside and asked, “Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.” "},{"verse":40,"text":"And they laughed at Him.  After He had put them all outside, He took the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and went in to see the child. "},{"verse":41,"text":"Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, “Talitha koum!” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!” "},{"verse":42,"text":"Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around. She was twelve years old, and at once they were utterly astounded. "},{"verse":43,"text":"Then Jesus gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and He told them to give her something to eat.  "}]},{"chapter":6,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" Jesus went on from there and came to His hometown, accompanied by His disciples. "},{"verse":2,"text":"When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked. “What is this wisdom He has been given? And how can He perform such miracles? "},{"verse":3,"text":"Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us as well?” And they took offense at Him. "},{"verse":4,"text":"Then Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honor.” "},{"verse":5,"text":"So He could not perform any miracles there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them. "},{"verse":6,"text":"And He was amazed at their unbelief.  And He went around from village to village, teaching the people. "},{"verse":7,"text":"  Then Jesus called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits. "},{"verse":8,"text":"He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts— "},{"verse":9,"text":"and to wear sandals, but not a second tunic. "},{"verse":10,"text":"And He told them, “When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area. "},{"verse":11,"text":"If anyone will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that place, as a testimony against them.” "},{"verse":12,"text":"So they set out and preached that the people should repent. "},{"verse":13,"text":"They also drove out many demons and healed many of the sick, anointing them with oil. "},{"verse":14,"text":"  Now King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known, and people were saying, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.” "},{"verse":15,"text":"Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” "},{"verse":16,"text":"But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!” "},{"verse":17,"text":"For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married. "},{"verse":18,"text":"For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!” "},{"verse":19,"text":"So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she had been unable, "},{"verse":20,"text":"because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he listened to him gladly. "},{"verse":21,"text":"On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. "},{"verse":22,"text":"When the daughter of Herodias came and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.” "},{"verse":23,"text":"And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom!” "},{"verse":24,"text":"Then she went out and asked her mother, “What should I request?”  And her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptist.” "},{"verse":25,"text":"At once the girl hurried back to the king with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.” "},{"verse":26,"text":"The king was consumed with sorrow, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her. "},{"verse":27,"text":"So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison. "},{"verse":28,"text":"The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the girl, who gave it to her mother. "},{"verse":29,"text":"When John’s disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb. "},{"verse":30,"text":"  Meanwhile, the apostles gathered around Jesus and brought Him news of all they had done and taught.

"},{"verse":32,"text":"So they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place. "},{"verse":33,"text":"But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before them. "},{"verse":34,"text":"When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things. "},{"verse":35,"text":"By now the hour was already late. So the disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. "},{"verse":36,"text":"Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” "},{"verse":37,"text":"But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.”  They asked Him, “Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii to give all of them bread to eat?” "},{"verse":38,"text":"“Go and see how many loaves you have,” He told them.  And after checking, they said, “Five—and two fish.” "},{"verse":39,"text":"Then Jesus directed them to have the people sit in groups on the green grass. "},{"verse":40,"text":"So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. "},{"verse":41,"text":"Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all. "},{"verse":42,"text":"They all ate and were satisfied, "},{"verse":43,"text":"and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. "},{"verse":44,"text":"And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves. "},{"verse":45,"text":"  Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd. "},{"verse":46,"text":"After bidding them farewell, He went up on the mountain to pray. "},{"verse":47,"text":"When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on land. "},{"verse":48,"text":"He could see that the disciples were straining to row, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them, "},{"verse":49,"text":"but when they saw Him walking on the sea, they cried out, thinking He was a ghost— "},{"verse":50,"text":"for they all saw Him and were terrified.  But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.” "},{"verse":51,"text":"Then He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. And the disciples were utterly astounded, "},{"verse":52,"text":"for they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts had been hardened. "},{"verse":53,"text":"  When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and moored the boat. "},{"verse":54,"text":"As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus "},{"verse":55,"text":"and ran through that whole region, carrying the sick on mats to wherever they heard He was. "},{"verse":56,"text":"And wherever He went—villages and towns and countrysides—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.  "}]},{"chapter":7,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus, "},{"verse":2,"text":"and they saw some of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is, unwashed. "},{"verse":3,"text":"Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially."},{"verse":4,"text":"And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining."},{"verse":5,"text":"So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.” "},{"verse":6,"text":"Jesus answered them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written:  ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. "},{"verse":7,"text":"They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’  "},{"verse":8,"text":"You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men.” "},{"verse":9,"text":"He went on to say, “You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain your own tradition.

These seats belong to those for whom they have been prepared.” "},{"verse":41,"text":"When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. "},{"verse":42,"text":"So Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them.

"},{"verse":10,"text":"He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,  ‘though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’  "},{"verse":11,"text":"Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. "},{"verse":12,"text":"The seeds along the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. "},{"verse":13,"text":"The seeds on rocky ground are those who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a season, but in the time of testing, they fall away. "},{"verse":14,"text":"The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature.

He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!” "},{"verse":26,"text":"  Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee. "},{"verse":27,"text":"When Jesus stepped ashore, He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in the tombs.

I beg You not to torture me!” "},{"verse":29,"text":"For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places. "},{"verse":30,"text":"“What is your name?” Jesus asked.  “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. "},{"verse":31,"text":"And the demons kept begging Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss. "},{"verse":32,"text":"There on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding.

"},{"verse":40,"text":"  When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him. "},{"verse":41,"text":"Just then a synagogue leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged Him to come to his house, "},{"verse":42,"text":"because his only daughter, who was about twelve, was dying.

But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter, “the people are crowding and pressing against You.” "},{"verse":46,"text":"But Jesus declared, “Someone touched Me, for I know that power has gone out from Me.” "},{"verse":47,"text":"Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched Him and how she had immediately been healed. "},{"verse":48,"text":"“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace.” "},{"verse":49,"text":"While He was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not bother the Teacher anymore.” "},{"verse":50,"text":"But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.” "},{"verse":51,"text":"When He entered the house, He did not allow anyone to go in with Him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother. "},{"verse":52,"text":"Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and mourning for her.

For some were saying that John had risen from the dead, "},{"verse":8,"text":"others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that a prophet of old had arisen. "},{"verse":9,"text":"“I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to see Jesus. "},{"verse":10,"text":"  Then the apostles returned and reported to Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew to a town called Bethsaida. "},{"verse":11,"text":"But the crowds found out and followed Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and He healed those who needed healing. "},{"verse":12,"text":"As the day neared its end, the Twelve came to Jesus and said, “Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside for lodging and provisions. For we are in a desolate place here.” "},{"verse":13,"text":"But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.”  “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered, “unless we go and buy food for all these people.” "},{"verse":14,"text":"(There were about five thousand men.)  He told His disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” "},{"verse":15,"text":"They did so, and everyone was seated. "},{"verse":16,"text":"Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples to set before the people. "},{"verse":17,"text":"They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. "},{"verse":18,"text":"  One day as Jesus was praying in private and the disciples were with Him, He questioned them: “Who do the crowds say I am?” "},{"verse":19,"text":"They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that a prophet of old has arisen.” "},{"verse":20,"text":"“But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?”  Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” "},{"verse":21,"text":"  Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. "},{"verse":22,"text":"“The Son of Man must suffer many things,” He said. “He must be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.” "},{"verse":23,"text":"  Then Jesus said to all of them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me. "},{"verse":24,"text":"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. "},{"verse":25,"text":"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit his very self? "},{"verse":26,"text":"If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. "},{"verse":27,"text":"But I tell you truthfully, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.” "},{"verse":28,"text":"  About eight days after Jesus had said these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray. "},{"verse":29,"text":"And as He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothes became radiantly white. "},{"verse":30,"text":"Suddenly two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus. "},{"verse":31,"text":"They appeared in glory and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. "},{"verse":32,"text":"Meanwhile Peter and his companions were overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with Him. "},{"verse":33,"text":"As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) "},{"verse":34,"text":"While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. "},{"verse":35,"text":"And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to Him!” "},{"verse":36,"text":"After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen. "},{"verse":37,"text":"  The next day, when they came down from the mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd. "},{"verse":38,"text":"Suddenly a man in the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only child.

Bring your son here.” "},{"verse":42,"text":"Even while the boy was approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. "},{"verse":43,"text":"  And they were all astonished at the greatness of God.  While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples, "},{"verse":44,"text":"“Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” "},{"verse":45,"text":"But they did not understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. "},{"verse":46,"text":"  Then an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. "},{"verse":47,"text":"But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside Him.

"},{"verse":8,"text":"And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” "},{"verse":9,"text":"  Then He proceeded to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to some tenants, and went away for a long time. "},{"verse":10,"text":"At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed. "},{"verse":11,"text":"So he sent another servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed. "},{"verse":12,"text":"Then he sent a third, but they wounded him and threw him out. "},{"verse":13,"text":"‘What shall I do?’ asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’ "},{"verse":14,"text":"But when the tenants saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ "},{"verse":15,"text":"So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.  What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? "},{"verse":16,"text":"He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.”  And when the people heard this, they said, “May such a thing never happen!” "},{"verse":17,"text":"But Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written:  ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?  "},{"verse":18,"text":"Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.” "},{"verse":19,"text":"  When the scribes and chief priests realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people. "},{"verse":20,"text":"So they watched Him closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor. "},{"verse":21,"text":"“Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that You speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. "},{"verse":22,"text":"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” "},{"verse":23,"text":"But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them, "},{"verse":24,"text":"“Show Me a denarius.

"},{"verse":25,"text":"So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” "},{"verse":26,"text":"And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people; and amazed at His answer, they fell silent. "},{"verse":27,"text":"  Then some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to question Him. "},{"verse":28,"text":"“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him. "},{"verse":29,"text":"Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a wife, but died childless. "},{"verse":30,"text":"Then the second "},{"verse":31,"text":"and the third married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children. "},{"verse":32,"text":"And last of all, the woman died. "},{"verse":33,"text":"So then, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.” "},{"verse":34,"text":"Jesus answered, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage. "},{"verse":35,"text":"But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage. "},{"verse":36,"text":"In fact, they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God. "},{"verse":37,"text":"Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ "},{"verse":38,"text":"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.” "},{"verse":39,"text":"Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well!” "},{"verse":40,"text":"And they did not dare to question Him any further. "},{"verse":41,"text":"  Then Jesus declared, “How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David?

They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets. "},{"verse":47,"text":"They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.”  "}]},{"chapter":21,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, "},{"verse":2,"text":"and He saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins."},{"verse":3,"text":"“Truly I tell you,” He said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others. "},{"verse":4,"text":"For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.” "},{"verse":5,"text":"  As some of the disciples were remarking how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated gifts, Jesus said, "},{"verse":6,"text":"“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” "},{"verse":7,"text":"“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?” "},{"verse":8,"text":"Jesus answered, “See to it that you are not deceived.

Make preparations there.” "},{"verse":13,"text":"So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover. "},{"verse":14,"text":"  When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles. "},{"verse":15,"text":"And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering.

"},{"verse":24,"text":" A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them would be considered the greatest. "},{"verse":25,"text":"So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors. "},{"verse":26,"text":"But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.

"},{"verse":36,"text":"“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. "},{"verse":37,"text":"For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.” "},{"verse":38,"text":"So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.”  “That is enough,” He answered. "},{"verse":39,"text":"  Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him. "},{"verse":40,"text":"When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.” "},{"verse":41,"text":"And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed, "},{"verse":42,"text":"“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.” "},{"verse":43,"text":"Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him. "},{"verse":44,"text":"And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground."},{"verse":45,"text":"When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. "},{"verse":46,"text":"“Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.” "},{"verse":47,"text":"  While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him. "},{"verse":48,"text":"But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” "},{"verse":49,"text":"Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” "},{"verse":50,"text":"And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. "},{"verse":51,"text":"But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.

"},{"verse":53,"text":"Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.” "},{"verse":54,"text":"  Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance. "},{"verse":55,"text":"When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. "},{"verse":56,"text":"A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said. "},{"verse":57,"text":"But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said. "},{"verse":58,"text":"A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.”  But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” "},{"verse":59,"text":"About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.” "},{"verse":60,"text":"“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied.  While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. "},{"verse":61,"text":"And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.  Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.” "},{"verse":62,"text":"And he went outside and wept bitterly. "},{"verse":63,"text":"  The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him. "},{"verse":64,"text":"They blindfolded Him and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?” "},{"verse":65,"text":"And they said many other blasphemous things against Him. "},{"verse":66,"text":"  At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin and said, "},{"verse":67,"text":"“If You are the Christ, tell us.”  Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe.

"},{"verse":69,"text":"But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” "},{"verse":70,"text":"So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?”  He replied, “You say that I am.” "},{"verse":71,"text":"“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”  "}]},{"chapter":23,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate. "},{"verse":2,"text":"And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.” "},{"verse":3,"text":"So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”  “You have said so,” Jesus replied. "},{"verse":4,"text":"Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” "},{"verse":5,"text":"But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.” "},{"verse":6,"text":" When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. "},{"verse":7,"text":"And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time. "},{"verse":8,"text":"When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle. "},{"verse":9,"text":"Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer. "},{"verse":10,"text":"Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him. "},{"verse":11,"text":"And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate.

Release Barabbas to us!” "},{"verse":19,"text":"(Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)

"},{"verse":25,"text":"As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will. "},{"verse":26,"text":"  As the soldiers led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus. "},{"verse":27,"text":"A great number of people followed Him, including women who kept mourning and wailing for Him. "},{"verse":28,"text":"But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee: "},{"verse":7,"text":"‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’” "},{"verse":8,"text":"Then they remembered His words. "},{"verse":9,"text":"And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. "},{"verse":10,"text":"It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. "},{"verse":11,"text":"But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women. "},{"verse":12,"text":"Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. "},{"verse":13,"text":"  That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. "},{"verse":14,"text":"They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.

"},{"verse":17,"text":"He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?”  They stood still, with sadness on their faces. "},{"verse":18,"text":"One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?” "},{"verse":19,"text":"“What things?” He asked.  “The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.

"},{"verse":21,"text":"But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place. "},{"verse":22,"text":"Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, "},{"verse":23,"text":"but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive. "},{"verse":24,"text":"Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.” "},{"verse":25,"text":"Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”  "}]},{"chapter":10,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" “Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. "},{"verse":2,"text":"But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. "},{"verse":3,"text":"The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice.

"},{"verse":5,"text":"But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.” "},{"verse":6,"text":"Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them.

I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.” "},{"verse":19,"text":"Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message. "},{"verse":20,"text":"Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?” "},{"verse":21,"text":"But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” "},{"verse":22,"text":" At that time the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, "},{"verse":23,"text":"and Jesus was walking in the temple courts in Solomon’s Colonnade. "},{"verse":24,"text":"So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.” "},{"verse":25,"text":"“I already told you,” Jesus replied, “but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf. "},{"verse":26,"text":"But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe. "},{"verse":27,"text":"My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.

No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand. "},{"verse":30,"text":"I and the Father are one.” "},{"verse":31,"text":"At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him. "},{"verse":32,"text":"But Jesus responded, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?” "},{"verse":33,"text":"“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.” "},{"verse":34,"text":"Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’? "},{"verse":35,"text":"If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken— "},{"verse":36,"text":"then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world?

"},{"verse":38,"text":"But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.” "},{"verse":39,"text":"At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp. "},{"verse":40,"text":" Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there. "},{"verse":41,"text":"Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign, everything he said about this man was true.” "},{"verse":42,"text":"And many in that place believed in Jesus.  "}]},{"chapter":11,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":"At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. "},{"verse":2,"text":"(Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet with her hair.) "},{"verse":3,"text":"So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.” "},{"verse":4,"text":"When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” "},{"verse":5,"text":"Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. "},{"verse":6,"text":"So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days, "},{"verse":7,"text":"and then He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.” "},{"verse":8,"text":"“Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?” "},{"verse":9,"text":"Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world. "},{"verse":10,"text":"But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.” "},{"verse":11,"text":"After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.” "},{"verse":12,"text":"His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.” "},{"verse":13,"text":"They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus. "},{"verse":14,"text":"So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, "},{"verse":15,"text":"and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” "},{"verse":16,"text":"Then Thomas called Didymus said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.” "},{"verse":17,"text":" When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb. "},{"verse":18,"text":"Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles away, "},{"verse":19,"text":"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother. "},{"verse":20,"text":"So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary stayed at home. "},{"verse":21,"text":"Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. "},{"verse":22,"text":"But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.” "},{"verse":23,"text":"“Your brother will rise again,” Jesus told her. "},{"verse":24,"text":"Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” "},{"verse":25,"text":"Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies. "},{"verse":26,"text":"And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?” "},{"verse":27,"text":"“Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.” "},{"verse":28,"text":"After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” "},{"verse":29,"text":"And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him. "},{"verse":30,"text":"Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. "},{"verse":31,"text":"When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. "},{"verse":32,"text":"When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.” "},{"verse":33,"text":"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. "},{"verse":34,"text":"“Where have you put him?” He asked.  “Come and see, Lord,” they answered. "},{"verse":35,"text":"Jesus wept. "},{"verse":36,"text":"Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!” "},{"verse":37,"text":"But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept Lazarus from dying?” "},{"verse":38,"text":"  Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. "},{"verse":39,"text":"“Take away the stone,” Jesus said.  “Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.” "},{"verse":40,"text":"Jesus replied, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” "},{"verse":41,"text":"So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. "},{"verse":42,"text":"I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.” "},{"verse":43,"text":"After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” "},{"verse":44,"text":"The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a cloth.  “Unwrap him and let him go,” Jesus told them. "},{"verse":45,"text":"  Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him. "},{"verse":46,"text":"But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. "},{"verse":47,"text":"Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs. "},{"verse":48,"text":"If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” "},{"verse":49,"text":"But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all! "},{"verse":50,"text":"You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.” "},{"verse":51,"text":"Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation, "},{"verse":52,"text":"and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one. "},{"verse":53,"text":"So from that day on they plotted to kill Him. "},{"verse":54,"text":"As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples. "},{"verse":55,"text":"Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover. "},{"verse":56,"text":"They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? Will He come to the feast at all?” "},{"verse":57,"text":"But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where He was must report it, so that they could arrest Him.  "}]},{"chapter":12,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":" Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. "},{"verse":2,"text":"So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with Him. "},{"verse":3,"text":"Then Mary took about a pint of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. "},{"verse":4,"text":"But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray Him, asked, "},{"verse":5,"text":"“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?” "},{"verse":6,"text":"Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it. "},{"verse":7,"text":"“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “She has kept this perfume in preparation for the day of My burial. "},{"verse":8,"text":"The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me.” "},{"verse":9,"text":" Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of Him, but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. "},{"verse":10,"text":"So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, "},{"verse":11,"text":"for on account of him many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus. "},{"verse":12,"text":"  The next day the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. "},{"verse":13,"text":"They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting:  “Hosanna!”   “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”   “Blessed is the King of Israel!”  "},{"verse":14,"text":"Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it, as it is written:  "},{"verse":15,"text":"“Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion. See, your King is coming, seated on the colt of a donkey.”  "},{"verse":16,"text":"At first His disciples did not understand these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had been done to Him, and they realized that these very things had also been written about Him. "},{"verse":17,"text":"Meanwhile, many people continued to testify that they had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead. "},{"verse":18,"text":"That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. "},{"verse":19,"text":"Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!” "},{"verse":20,"text":" Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast. "},{"verse":21,"text":"They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” "},{"verse":22,"text":"Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went and told Jesus. "},{"verse":23,"text":"But Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. "},{"verse":24,"text":"Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a seed; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. "},{"verse":25,"text":"Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. "},{"verse":26,"text":"If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, My servant will be as well. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him. "},{"verse":27,"text":"Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour. "},{"verse":28,"text":"Father, glorify Your name!”  Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” "},{"verse":29,"text":"The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him. "},{"verse":30,"text":"In response, Jesus said, “This voice was not for My benefit, but yours. "},{"verse":31,"text":"Now judgment is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out. "},{"verse":32,"text":"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.” "},{"verse":33,"text":"He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. "},{"verse":34,"text":"The crowd replied, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can You say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” "},{"verse":35,"text":"Then Jesus told them, “For a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. "},{"verse":36,"text":"While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light.”  After Jesus had spoken these things, He went away and was hidden from them. "},{"verse":37,"text":" Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him. "},{"verse":38,"text":"This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet:  “Lord, who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”  "},{"verse":39,"text":"For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says:  "},{"verse":40,"text":"“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they cannot see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.”  "},{"verse":41,"text":"Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him. "},{"verse":42,"text":"Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue. "},{"verse":43,"text":"For they loved praise from men more than praise from God. "},{"verse":44,"text":"Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent Me. "},{"verse":45,"text":"And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me. "},{"verse":46,"text":"I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain in darkness.

"},{"verse":48,"text":"There is a judge for the one who rejects Me and does not receive My words: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. "},{"verse":49,"text":"I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and how to say it.

So I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.”  "}]},{"chapter":13,"verses":[{"verse":1,"text":"It was now just before the Passover Feast, and Jesus knew that His hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father.

"},{"verse":3,"text":"Jesus knew that the Father had delivered all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God. "},{"verse":4,"text":"So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist. "},{"verse":5,"text":"After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that was around Him.

Then Jesus said to Judas, “What you are about to do, do quickly.” "},{"verse":28,"text":"But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him.

Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture:  “They divided My garments among them, and cast lots for My clothing.”   So that is what the soldiers did.

"},{"verse":31,"text":"  It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.
